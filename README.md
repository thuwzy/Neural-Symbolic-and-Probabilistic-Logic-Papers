# Neural Module Networks Literature

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

A curated list of papers on neural module networks. Inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/safe-graph/graph-adversarial-learning-literature).

Papers are sorted by their uploaded dates in descending order. Each paper is with a description of a few words.

Looking forward to your contribution!
